# Github - The Basics
## Why Github?
Alternatives:
- [Gitlab](http://gitlab.org/)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
- [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/)
- [etc...](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=github+alternatives)  

Github has become the defacto standard.
it is where developers *are*:  
"sign in with facebook/twitter/google" is "sign in with github" for developer sites
