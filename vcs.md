# What is Version Control?

## Versioning

coordination  
sharing  
history  
"auto save"  
you already do this in some form:
```
report_final.doc
report_final-final.doc
report_final-final-THIS-ONE.doc
report_v1.xls
report_v2.xls
report_v3.xls
report_v3.1.xls
...
etc
```

## Repositories
A "group" of files, like a directory.  Changes to files in the repo are tracked, the history is saved.

## Forking
Making a copy of someone else's repo as your own.  Changes to the "upstream" fork can be brought in, you can request to "pull" in downstream changes to the original repo.

## Branching
A localized fork.
