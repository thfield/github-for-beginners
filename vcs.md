# What is Version Control?

## Versioning

coordination  
sharing  
history  
"auto save"  
you already do this in some form:
```
report_final.doc
report_final-final.doc
report_final-final-THIS-ONE.doc
report_v1.xls
report_v2.xls
report_v3.xls
report_v3.1.xls
...
etc
```

## Repositories
A "group" of files, like a directory.  Changes to files in the repo are tracked, the history is saved.

## Forking
Making a copy of another person or organization's repo.  Both parties can work on their repos at the same time, independent of one another. Changes to the "upstream" fork can be merged with your branch and, you can request to "pull" your downstream changes into the original repo.

## Branching
Making a copy within a repo.  You can make changes to the code on this new branch without affecting the old branch.  If you wanted to make a big change without worrying about breaking something, you can make a new branch and try out crazy new ideas.  When you're done, you can merge the two branches together.

1. Repositories

1. You work on your repo...
1. While Octocat works independently on his.
