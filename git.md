# Git - The Basics

## Repositories
A "group" of files, like a directory.  Changes to files in the repo are tracked, the history is saved.

## Forking
Making a copy of another person or organization's repo.  Both parties can work on their repos at the same time, independent of one another. Changes to the "upstream" fork can be merged with your branch and, you can request to "pull" your downstream changes into the original repo.

## Branching
Making a copy within a repo.  You can make changes to the code on this new branch without affecting the old branch.  If you wanted to make a big change without worrying about breaking something, you can make a new branch and try out crazy new ideas.  When you're done, you can merge the two branches together.

## Commits
A snapshot of files in a certain state, like a video game "save point".  You can revisit your files at a given commit at any time.
